# Kaggle-Microsoft-Malware-Prediction

https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction

The malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways.

With more than one billion enterprise and consumer customers, Microsoft takes this problem very seriously and is deeply invested in improving security.

As one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. As with their previous, Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.

Can you help protect more than one billion machines from damage BEFORE it happens?


## Notes:
1. Reducing memory consumption: used the method introduced by fabiendaniel (https://www.kaggle.com/fabiendaniel/detecting-malwares-with-lgbm)

2. Feature engineering: in order to increase speed, I found the 31 less important features (by repeating 1M sample size 10 times) and dropped them from the dataframe. Surprisingly, the Leaderboard score increased from 0.672 to 0.673. 

3. Final run with LGBM using 4M sample from training dataset. 

4. I also tried XGBoost and tuned parameters using grid_search; seems to be slower than LGBM.
